# quantitative-finance-notebooks

## A collection of educational notebooks covering key mathematical concepts and their applications in quantitative finance.

This repository aims to enhance understanding of quantitative finance by combining mathematical theory with coding examples in Python. Prerequisites include a basic knowledge in statistics, stochastic calculus, financial derivatives terminology, and Python programming. This repository is made possible thanks to some excellent academic textbooks and GitHub repositories, which can be found below. Hopefully, readers will feel they have a firmer grasp of the topics and find inspiration for practical applications!
