    "## 1. Stopping Times\n",
    "\n",
    "European option contracts specify an expiration date, and if the option is to be exercised at all, the exercise must occur on the expiration date. An *American* option allows the owner to choose to exercise at any time up to and including the expiration date. Because of this early exercise feature, such an option is at least as valuable as its European counterpart. Sometimes the difference in value is negligible or even zero, and then American and European options are close or exact substitutes. We shall see that the early exercise feature for a call on a stock paying no dividends is worthless; American and European calls on such a stock have the same price. In other cases, most notably put options, the value of this early exercise feature, the so-called *early exercise premium*, can be substantial. An intermediate option between American and European is *Bermudan*, an option that permits early exercise but only on a contractually specified finite set of dates.\n",
    "\n",
    "Because an American option can be exercised at any time prior to its expiration, it can never be worth less than the payoff associated with immediate exercise. This is called the *intrinsic value* of the option. In contrast to the case for a European option, whose discounted price process is a martingale under the risk-neutral measure, the discounted price process of an American option is a supermartingale under this measure. The holder of this option may fail to exercise at the optimal exercise date, and in this case the discounted option price has a tendency to fall; hence, the supermartingale property. During any period of time in which it is not optimal to exercise, however, the discounted price process behaves as a martingale.\n",
    "\n",
    "To price an American option, just as with a European option, we could imagine selling the option in exchange for some initial capital and then consider how to use this capital to hedge the short position in the option. In this case, we would need to be ready to pay off the option at all times prior to the expiration date because we do not know when it will be exercised.\n",

    "The simplest interesting American option is the *perpetual American put*. It is interesting because the optimal exercise policy is not obvious, and it is simple because this policy can be determined explicitly. Although this is not a traded option, we begin our discussion with it in order to present in a simple context the ideas behind the subsequent analysis of more realistic options.\n",

The price of the option at time zero is the risk-neutral expected payoff of the option, discounted from the exercise time back to time zero. If the option is\n",
    "never exercised, its payoff is zero. This explains the term under the expectation on the right-hand side of equation (2.1.2). The owner of the option should choose the exercise strategy that maximizes this expected payoff, discounted back to time zero, and thus we define the price of the option to be the maximum over $\\tau \\in \\mathcal{T}$ of the discounted expected payoffs."

We assume there are times $0 < t_1 < t_2 < \\cdots < t_n < T$, and at each time $t_j$ the dividend paid is $a_j S(t_j-)$, where $S(t_j-)$ denotes the asset price just prior to the dividend payment.

    "We will not go through the details here, but Shreve (2008, pp. 363 - 368) shows that it is not optimal to exercise an American call on this asset except possibly immediately before a dividend payment. The price of the call is shown to satisfy the Black-Scholes-Merton PDE between dividend payment dates. At dividend payment dates, the price of the call is the maximum of the call's intrinsic value and the price of the call after the dividend is paid and the stock price is reduced by the amount of the payment. These observations lead to a recursive algorithm for determining the price. "
