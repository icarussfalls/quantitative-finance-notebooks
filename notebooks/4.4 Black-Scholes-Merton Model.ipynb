    "## 1. Black-Scholes Closed Formula\n",
    "\n",
    "Consider a European call option that pays $(S(T) - K)^+$ at time $T$. The strike price $K$ is some nonnegative constant. Black, Scholes, and Merton argued that the value of this call at any time should depend on the time (more precisely, on the time to expiration) and on the value of the stock price at that time, and of course it should also depend on a constant rate of interest, $r$, the volatility of the stock, $\\sigma$, and the contractual strike price, $K$. Only two of these quantities, time and stock price, are variable. Following this reasoning, we let $c(t, x)$ denote the value of the call at time $t$ if the stock price at that time is $S(t) = x$. \n",
    "\n",
    "There is nothing random about the function $c(t, x)$. However, the value of the option is random; it is the stochastic process $c(t, S(t))$ obtained by replacing the dummy variable $x$ by the random stock price $S(t)$ in this function. At the initial time, we do not know the future stock prices $S(t)$ and hence do not know the future option values $c(t, S(t))$. Our goal is to determine the function $c(t, x)$ so we at least have a formula for the future option values in terms of the future stock prices."
